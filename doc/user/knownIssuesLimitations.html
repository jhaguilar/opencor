            The following issues/limitations have been reported/observed while using OpenCOR on our <a href="supportedPlatforms.html">supported platforms</a>. So, they may apply to you or not, depending on the platform you use.
        </p>
        
        <div class="section">
            Windows, Linux and OS X
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>
                By default, OpenCOR uses your system's language for menus, dialog boxes, etc., as long as it is either English or French (please <a href="user/contactUs.html">contact us</a> if you would like OpenCOR to support another language). If your system uses another language, then OpenCOR will default to English. Otherwise, if you specifically specify English or French, then please be aware that system messages, dialog boxes, etc. will still be displayed in your system's language.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="section">
            Windows
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>
                OpenCOR's File Browser plugin may, on some systems, result in OpenCOR being slow to respond at startup. This has nothing to do with OpenCOR, but with Windows or, more likely, a program which tightly integrates with it. There are <a href="http://www.brighthub.com/computing/windows-platform/articles/86552.aspx">several known causes and solutions</a> to this problem. However, should none of those solutions work for you, you might then have to uninstall the plugin.
